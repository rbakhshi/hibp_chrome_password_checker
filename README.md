# Check your passwords against [HaveIBeenPwnd](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
Ruby script to check if your list of passwords stored in Chrome have been leaked somewhere on the web.

This is a very simple ruby script. 

## How to use it?
1. Export your passwords from Chrome
2. (The file should be named "Chrome Passwords.csv")
3. (Yes, I know. I could be more flexible to accept any file as input ;) )
4. Put the password file in the same directory as the script
5. run the script! WARNING: it will print your passwords to the standard output!
